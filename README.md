# Randomized Block Design Analysis

Python module designed to analyze randomized block design. Blocks can be population segments derived from a predictive model, an uplift score, or any business rule. Individuals within each block have to be randomized in a treated and control group. The sample size ratio between treated and control can differ between blocks. When combining blocks, the Weighted Average Treatment Effect is calculated to mitigate the confounding effect of blocks and avoid Simpson's paradox.

With *blockeval*, users can:
- Estimate the treatment effect for each block
- Roll-up the results to get the overall effects for groups of blocks
- Compare the treatment effects between blocks or groups of blocks
- Estimate the overall treatment effect of the campaign
- Resolve Simpsonâ€™s paradox
- Handle non-normal distributions with bootstrapping

## Medium Blog Post

We wrote a comprehensive review of *blockeval* in a Medium blog [post](https://medium.com/cvs-health-tech-blog/analyzing-randomized-block-design-and-uplift-campaigns-with-python-9a9dc5c8b064) with a companion [notebook](https://github.com/cvs-health/blockeval/blob/main/examples/medium_post.ipynb).
